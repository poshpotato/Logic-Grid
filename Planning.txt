Notes for logic graph drawing:
Going to do it via HTML for fun- like murdle.
Need to have an element for every box, and then a larger element with thicker outlines for groupings.
i CAN use unicode for emoji labels- should probably leave it up to the user to designate these emojis.
Problem decomposition:
Visual elements
	HTML
		Uses a grid (not a table! it's not a full grid!)
		The grid needs to be able to use a coordinate system.
			It needs to be able to use TWO, actually- one for the larger boxes, then one for individual relations.
			I'm not quite sure of the specifics of doing this, but I'm sure I can figure it out!
	Canvas
		Potentially easier.
		more one-way than HTML, but its easier to draw things.
Internal logic
	Undetermined number of variable sets
		Sets can be of differing sizes
			At declaration, these sets will have an unchanging size, so an Array can be used.
		One set will be the Primary Set, which exists only on the top row. This changes not much for internal calculations, but needs to be taken into account for  UI.
		To get the grid coordinate of a correlation, we use (set1 index + item1 index), (set2 index + item2 index).
			!Potentially, we use nested coordinates: one x,y for the sets that are being correlated, then another x,y for the items being correlated.
			
Checklist:
Read number of sets- done!
	Draw large set boxes, nothing inside for now.
Read number of items in each set
	On entering number of sets, should pop up a bunch of input things for the user to input the size of each set.
		They should be able to specify, ideally, the values of each element of each set.
	Draw smaller set boxes
	Adjust large box size to fit correct number of elements
	Label rows and columns (using number letter pairs. number for set index, letter for item index.)
